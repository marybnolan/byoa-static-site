# About

Welcome to my website! My name is [Your Name], and I built this site to share my thoughts, projects, and resources with the world.

## What is this site?

This is a simple static website built using Markdown for content and a lightweight build process. The goal is to keep things fast, minimal, and easy to maintain.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown makes it easy to write and edit content without worrying about complex formatting or tools. It keeps the focus on writing.
