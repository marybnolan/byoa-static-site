# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a simple example of how the blog system works.

## Why I Built This Site

I wanted to create a simple, fast website that was easy to maintain. By using Markdown for content and a basic build process, I can focus on writing rather than dealing with complex frameworks.

## How It Works

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Run the build script
3. Get clean, static HTML files

The build process is simple and efficient, making it easy to add new content whenever needed.

## What's Next?

I plan to add more features like:
- A contact form
- Newsletter integration
- More blog posts

Stay tuned for updates!
